# Proxmox Ansible

**Automate your Proxmox server setup in minutes instead of hours.**

## What This Does

This project uses [Ansible][ansible]—an industry-standard automation
tool—to configure [Proxmox VE][proxmox] servers automatically. Instead
of manually logging into each server and typing commands, you run one
command and all your servers are configured identically.

### The Problem It Solves

Setting up a Proxmox server properly takes time:

- Installing monitoring tools
- Configuring swap space for memory management
- Tuning kernel parameters for performance
- Setting system limits so applications don't crash

Doing this manually on one server takes 30-60 minutes. On multiple
servers? Hours of repetitive work, with the risk of human error making
each server slightly different.

### The Solution

Run a single command, and every server gets the same professional
configuration:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml
```

**Time saved**: 30-60 minutes per server
**Consistency**: Every server configured identically
**Repeatability**: Add a new server? One command. Rebuild? One command.

## What Gets Configured

| Component           | What It Does                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Common Packages** | Installs htop, iotop, monitoring   |
| **ZFS Swap**        | Creates optimized swap on ZFS      |
| **Kernel Tuning**   | Optimizes memory and disk settings |
| **System Limits**   | Increases file and process limits  |

### Why Each Matters

- **Common Packages**: See what your server is doing at a glance
- **ZFS Swap**: Prevents out-of-memory crashes when VMs use too much RAM
- **Kernel Tuning**: Better performance for NVMe drives and VMs
- **System Limits**: Prevents "too many open files" errors under load

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A computer with [Ansible][ansible-install] installed (Mac, Linux, WSL)
- SSH access to your Proxmox server(s)
- Proxmox VE 8.x (Debian 12 based)

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JacobPEvans/ansible-proxmox.git
   cd ansible-proxmox
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
   ```

3. **Configure your inventory**

   ```bash
   cp inventory/hosts.yml.example inventory/hosts.yml
   # Edit inventory/hosts.yml with your server details
   ```

4. **Test the connection** (doesn't change anything)

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --check --diff
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration**

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml
   ```

## Customization

All settings have sensible defaults. Override them in
`inventory/group_vars/proxmox.yml`:

```yaml
# Swap size (default: 96GB - reduce for smaller systems)
zfs_swap_size: "32G"

# Kernel tuning (lower swappiness = prefer RAM over swap)
kernel_tuning_swappiness: 10

# System limits (increase for high-load applications)
ulimits_nofile: 65536
```

## Testing

This project includes automated tests using [Molecule][molecule]:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install molecule ansible-core

# Run tests
molecule test
```

## For Developers

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Linting

```bash
ansible-lint
yamllint .
```
