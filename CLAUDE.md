# Ansible Proxmox

Configure the Proxmox VE host itself (not applications).

## This Repo Owns

- Kernel tuning (vm.swappiness, hugepages)
- ZFS swap configuration
- System ulimits
- Proxmox monitoring (healthchecks)
- Crash diagnostics
- Common system packages

## Pipeline Role

This repo has **no direct pipeline role**. It ensures
the Proxmox host is stable and properly configured so
that VMs/containers (managed by other repos) can run
reliably.

Firewall rules for pipeline ports (1514-1518, 8088,
2055) are managed by `terraform-proxmox/modules/firewall/`.

## Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PROXMOX_VE_HOSTNAME` | Proxmox VE hostname |
| `PROXMOX_VM_SSH_USERNAME` | SSH user for Proxmox host |
| `PROXMOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH private key (used by scripts/run-ansible.sh) |
| `HEALTHCHECK_PING_KEY` | Healthchecks.io key |

`scripts/run-ansible.sh` writes `PROXMOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` to a temp file
and exports `ANSIBLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` pointing to it.

## Commands

```bash
# Via run script (handles SSH key from env)
doppler run -- ./scripts/run-ansible.sh playbooks/site.yml

# Or via uv directly
doppler run -- uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml

# Dry run
doppler run -- uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml \
  --check --diff

# Lint
uv run ansible-lint
```
